            <h2>Understanding Accountability</h2>
            <p>Accountability is the process of being responsible for your actions and their outcomes. It plays a crucial role in personal growth and self-awareness, helping you recognize how your behaviors affect your life and the lives of others.</p>

            <h2>Scenario: Accountability Challenge</h2>
            <p>Imagine you faced a situation where you failed to meet a commitment to a friend. Reflect on the following scenario:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Your friend relied on you to help them move, but you canceled at the last minute. How do you think they felt? What impact did this have on your relationship?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Consider the options below to address the situation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><button onclick="handleOptionA()">Option A: Apologize and offer to help another time.</button></li>
                <li><button onclick="handleOptionB()">Option B: Make excuses for your behavior.</button></li>
                <li><button onclick="handleOptionC()">Option C: Ignore the situation and move on.</button></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Follow-Up Questions</h2>
            <p>After making your choice, reflect on the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What motivated your choice?</li>
                <li>How did you feel about your decision?</li>
                <li>What could you do differently in the future to ensure you follow through on commitments?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Taking Ownership of Your Actions</h2>
            <p>Ownership involves recognizing and accepting your role in situations. To take ownership:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be honest about your mistakes.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge the feelings of those affected by your actions.</li>
                <li>Commit to making amends and improving your behavior.</li>
                <li>Reflect regularly on your actions and their impacts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Creating Accountability Partners</h2>
            <p>Consider finding an accountability partnerâ€”someone who supports you in your growth journey. They can help you stay on track and encourage you to reflect on your actions.</p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Write down the name of a person you trust and feel comfortable sharing your goals with:</p>
            <input type="text" id="partner-name" placeholder="Enter Name of Accountability Partner">
            <button onclick="savePartnerName()">Save Partner Name</button>

            <h2>Benefits of Accountability</h2>
            <p>Accountability can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stronger relationships built on trust and honesty.</li>
                <li>Improved self-discipline and motivation.</li>
