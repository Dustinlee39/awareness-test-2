            <h2>The Concept of Time-Shifted Reflection</h2>
            <p>Time-shifted reflection is a powerful technique that encourages you to consider past experiences and how you might handle similar situations in the future. By revisiting moments from your past, you can gain insights and learn valuable lessons that can influence your present and future decisions.</p>

            <h2>Reflecting on Past Social Dilemmas</h2>
            <p>Consider a past social dilemma you faced. Reflect on the situation using the guiding questions below:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Think back to a time when you faced a conflict with a friend. How did you react? What was the outcome? What would you do differently if you faced the same situation today?</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Guided Reflection Exercise</h2>
            <p>To engage in time-shifted reflection, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a specific event from your past that impacted you significantly.</li>
                <li>Answer the following questions:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What emotions did you experience at the time?</li>
                    <li>What thoughts went through your mind during that situation?</li>
                    <li>How did you respond, and what were the consequences of your actions?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Now, consider:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you could go back in time, what advice would you give yourself?</li>
                    <li>What lessons did you learn from this experience?</li>
                    <li>How can you apply these lessons to future situations?</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Time-Shifted Reflection Scenario</h2>
            <p>Imagine you are in a similar situation today. Reflect on the following:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Your colleague misunderstood a comment you made during a meeting. They reacted defensively, and tension arose. How would you handle this situation now?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Select an option to guide your response:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><button onclick="handleScenarioA()">Option A: Address the misunderstanding immediately.</button></li>
                <li><button onclick="handleScenarioB()">Option B: Avoid confrontation and let it pass.</button></li>
                <li><button onclick="handleScenarioC()">Option C: Discuss it privately later.</button></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Follow-Up Reflection</h2>
            <p>After selecting your option, reflect on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What influenced your choice of action?</li>
                <li>How might your past experience shape your response today?</li>
                <li>What are the potential outcomes of your chosen response?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Journaling Your Reflections</h2>
            <p>Consider keeping a reflection journal where you document your thoughts and insights from time-shifted reflections. This practice can help reinforce the lessons learned and track your personal growth over time.</p>
